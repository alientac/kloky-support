## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Is my data backed up?
Your data is included in your iPhone's regular iCloud backup if you have it enabled. Kloky doesn't have separate cloud sync.

### Can I sync between multiple devices?
Currently, Kloky stores data locally on each device. We're considering iCloud sync for a future update.

### How do I delete old records?
You can delete individual time entries by swiping left on them in the history view.

### What happens if I delete the app?
Your data will be removed with the app. Make sure to export important records before deleting.

### How accurate is the time tracking?
Kloky tracks time to the second and continues tracking even when the app is in the background.

### Can I track multiple activities at once?
No, Kloky tracks one activity at a time. You'll need to clock out of one activity before starting another.
